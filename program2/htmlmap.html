            <h2>Computer monitor</h2>
            <p>A computer monitor is an output device that displays information in pictorial form. 
                A monitor usually comprises the visual display, circuitry, casing, and power supply.
                 The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal 
                 display (TFT-LCD) with LED backlighting having replaced cold-cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) 
                 backlighting. Previous monitors used a cathode ray tube (CRT). Monitors are connected to 
                 the computer via VGA, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), HDMI, DisplayPort, 
                USB-C, low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) or other proprietary connectors and signals.</p>
